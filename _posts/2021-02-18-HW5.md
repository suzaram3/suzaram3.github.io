title: "Stupid or Solid?"

<p>I enjoyed reading the article about STUPID versus SOLID code. The author states that any of us who have programmed before have written STUPID code, which I also believe. When first learning to program we know very little. As we learn more our programming style improves and we learn how to program more efficiently. One block that struck me as a key takeaway was:
	
>You write code for people, not for computers. They don’t understand what you write anyway. Computers just understand 0 and 1. Programming languages are for humans.

Like the author stated the computer does not care nor understand how you write code it only understands the instructions. The programming style is for the author of the code and anyone else who looks at it. We as programmers will spend a significant amount of time looking at code others have written. We must make it as detailed as possible so others can understand what our code is designed to do. 

Learning to write SOLID code is viable and will make writing robust code easier in the long run. To write SOLID code it is best to take the time to understand common pitfalls that programmers face. Understanding these mistakes will help us learn how to prevent them and drastically improve our future code.</p>
