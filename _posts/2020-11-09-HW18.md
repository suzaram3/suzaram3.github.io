The problems with the object-oriented approach include the following. The object-oriented approach does not provide a constructor for managing the concurrency of shared resources. The uses of obscuring data, resulting in some hidden code that cannot be compiled. Within a system, this is possible but requires additional time. Within a real-time system, this cannot be implemented. Lastly, mutual exclusion is not supported in the object-oriented approach, which is the main component within real-time systems.

Fixed priced contracts have the possibility of increasing product risks. This is due to the contractor having financial control over the product. In order to make the product available at a fixed price, the contractor may sacrifice quality in order to keep the price from fluctuating. This can often result in neglect of the testing phase of the development cycle which leads to an incomplete product. Overall, this method of development puts a great burden on a single contractor which will likely lead to a product that is inferior to a team-based project.
