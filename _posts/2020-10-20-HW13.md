Configurability<br>
If each organization has a different specific requirement how do you configure each package for all the users? This can lead to overlap and repeated code. To avoid this allows each organization to setup up their preferences upfront to ensure they have the requirements from the initial implementation.

Multi-tenancy<br>
How can you ensure each user is confident they are working with their “own” copy of the software? At the same time, how are all the resources managed efficiently? This can be done using the idea of branches. At the root is the overall system and each branch can reflect each of the organization's versions of the overall system.

Scalability<br>
How does the system scale as the number of users grow?
Develop components in single states that do not require multiple dependencies. Design the overall system using asynchronous interaction so there are no wait periods between interactions. Manage resources efficiently so the different components do not deplete their resources thus compromising others.
