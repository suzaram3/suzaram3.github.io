<p> Chapter nine discusses the continuation of the software lifecycle. To prevent becoming obsolete software must remain relevant with each new release. To do that the developers have to reach out to the users to determine what is going to keep them engaged. What is working and what is not. Having open communication between users and developers ensures that the software will keep evolving within its lifecycle. Without feedback, the user's developers can never be certain what the next step is thus rendering the software obsolete. This concept is why the open-source community remains so strong today. With an open community, everyone is allowed to contribute in their own way ensuring projects are continuously improving to fit the need of the users.  </p>
