Our team continues to progress with our project. We are often ahead of our timeline and this allows us to keep a good pace without falling behind. One issue that we have run into is uploading files from a windows machine to our repository. Due to the formatting that is within these files on a windows machine caused our script to output some results that we were not expecting. After realizing this the issues were fixed easily and everything is running as intended. Having these issues is one of the best ways to learn about the smallest details and how they affect the overall project. I continue to learn a great deal about the software development process and look forward to working with the team to complete this project and continue the process next semester in CSCI 462.
