<p> Chapter five of the textbook discussed the importance of domain class development. Using certain methods can help create a sustainable codebase that is easily scalable and free or bugs. One of the most important techniques is to test code as it is written. Test driven development (TDD) allows testing to occur along side the development instead of just at the end of the project. This creates robust software that is bug free and prevents a massive testing cycle at the end of the project timeline. Taking the time to test as we go is essential to meeting deadlines and preventing delays. Reusing code is another essential technique which prevents having to write duplicate code. Code reuse allows developers to focus on the bigger picture without having to rewrite small portions that perform the same operations as previous code blocks. </p>
