### Reflections

The readings this week went further into the problems related to rushing software to development. As we further rely on software in our daily lives too often is it just pumped into the market without proper design and adequate testing. Take for instance a simple tool that is designed to monitor the pressure in our automobile tires. This device although simple is prone to failure and even corruption. A study was done that monitored how these devices communicate with the vehicle and how susceptible to interference from outside sources they are. If we are going to rely on software to keep us safe we have to ensure that when designing said software safety is at the forefront of that process. Too often is safety cut when deadlines draw nearer and budget cuts occur.
