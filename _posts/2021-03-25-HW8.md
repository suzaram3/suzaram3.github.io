<p> Chapter six discusses the concept of database development. Developing a database can seem like a daunting task but following some techniques can make it less painful. The first step in developing a database is to gather the requirements. Asking the users what their requirements allow the developers to understand how to structure the database and who gets access to what data. I remember when taking CSCI 332 Database Concepts that planning out a database was something we performed. We accomplished this by reading over requirements and using diagrams to understand the relationships between the data and the users. Having an adequate plan before implementing a database is key and will allow the developers to design a database that fits the need of the users. </p>
