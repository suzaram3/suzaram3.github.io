Program inspections are an effective technique for discovering errors in a program. Inspections can discover errors within tests and thus improve the effectiveness of said tests. Inspections often involve a team of programmers thus allow a different set of minds to look at each line of code to ensure the code is doing what is intended. This also ensures accountability for the author of the code to make sure they are submitting work that is correct and not filled with bugs.
