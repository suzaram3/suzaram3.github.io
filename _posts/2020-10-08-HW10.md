&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Reusing software leads to lower costs, faster development, and lower risks. This is an overall positive to the process of designing software. In regards to who owns the software is a complex issue. Yes, the company that contracted the engineers paid for a product that they received and technically belongs to them but the software is not a tangible object it is abstract in a sense where it does not belong to anyone. In this scenario, I believe in the open-source software idea that all software belongs to everyone since it is likely to help everyone which is what itâ€™s intention is overall.
