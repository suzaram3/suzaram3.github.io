&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Some person works for a wilderness weather station in a remote area. Due to frequent inclement weather this person often has to remote in to gather data from the wilderness weather station. First they must login into the weather system using secure credentials. The system will approve or deny these credentials.

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;After logging in they will gather a data report summary to analyze the current weather as well as any predications for the upcoming hours. The system should acknowledge that a report was requested and confirm or deny that the summary was sent.

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;I believe this is not a sound approach to testing. This approach seems like it would lead to non ethical work behavior. With engineers just exhausting their testing budget without actually committing to producing robust testing. Testing should be a main priority with designing software but it shouldn’t just be a sprint to exhaust the resources then call it quits. It should be meticulously implemented along the design process to ensure all components are as bug free as possible.
