Antilock braking
The most appropriate generic software process model is the waterfall model. Anti lock braking is a safety critical system. In the waterfall model, design requirements must be scheduled without flaws. This must pass before any implementation is deployed in a live environment. 

Virtual reality system
The most appropriate generic software process model is incremental development. With this project system design requirements can often change as the project progresses. Since there is no direct impact to human life the waterfall method would not benefit this project.

University accounting system
The most appropriate generic software process model is the waterfall model. Since there is already a system in place, requirements can be predicted. Also since this is a critical system it makes sense to use the waterfall model.

Travel planning system
The most appropriate generic software process model is incremental development. With this project the users requirement can change at any moment and may change multiple times. Thus it makes sense to focus on essential functions and save enhancements for further down the line.
