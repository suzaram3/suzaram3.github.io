I believe our team has done well so far with our project. I have enjoyed getting to know my team members and working together with them as we learn about the importance of testing. The whole objective feels like a culmination of the past classes taken at the College and wraps everything together as a whole which I appreciate. As of now, I think we are making excellent progress towards our goals. As a team, I believe our communication has contributed to our success. We are meeting within the class as well as outside of class to determine our progress and report any issues we come across. I look forward to our upcoming deliverables as well as learning more together as a team.
