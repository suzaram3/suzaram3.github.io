<p>Release early and often is a software development philosophy that defines the positive of releasing software and updates early and often. With constantly releasing updates it provides a better feedback medium between developers and users. With this method, users can ultimately determine the shape of the software, which better helps them in the long run since it creates their “perfect” version of the tool they need. Release early and often also aims to avoid creating software that no one will use. Since updates are constantly being applied, this keeps the software fresh and engaging with the users.</p>

<p>Documentation plays a major role in any sort of software development or even minor programs. When humans write code they are not writing it for the computer to understand. They write code so their human peers can understand their intentions. Without proper documentation the users are unable to figure out how the tools are supposed to work. This also applies to documentation on the development side. Often the code we write will never be touched by the author again so it is important to leave detailed documentation to how everything works so the next person can improve without causing serious malfunctions to the code base. </p>
