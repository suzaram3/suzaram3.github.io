My name is Mitch Suzara, I am a senior at the College of Charleston. I will be graduating in May with a major in Computer Science. After graduating I plan on landing a remote job in the web development field. With a remote job I would like to also buy a van that I can turn into a mobile home and travel around the country visiting national parks and taking in the great outdoors.
